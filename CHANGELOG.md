Firmware customization highlights:

- Dynamic/safe map behavior and map cache menu work.
- Explicit on-device mesh idle, map GPS/WiFi/tile source, and message sent/heard/ACK/failed status labels.
- Follow-up map waiting card and compact TX/RX status chips so blank maps and message state are less ambiguous.
- Per-message hop indicators: received packets show measured `H#`, unknown routes show `H?`, and outgoing limits show `TTL#` instead of pretending the send limit is a measured hop count.
- Tools screen-correction sequence.
- Forced physical USB serial API access for recovery.
- SD-card message journal at `/itsz/history/messages.jsonl`.
